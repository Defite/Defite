### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Nikita aka Defite. I'm frontend engineer in [Mail.ru](https://mail.ru). I develop [Webgrower](https://webgrower.ru/) - almost everyday magazine about web development, adore Jamstack and creating useless personal/blog/portfolio themes on top of Gatsby.js, Nuxt.js, Next.js and so on.
